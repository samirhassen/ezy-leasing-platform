## TYPE SAFETY ISSUES

| Issue | Location | Risk | Recommended Fix |
|-------|----------|------|-----------------|
| Use of `unknown` in JSON parsing and generic object handling | `loan-schedule/index.ts`: lines 22-23 | May silently accept or mishandle malformed input, leading to runtime errors or security issues | Use a schema library (e.g., Zod) for input validation and type assertion. Return a 400 error for invalid payloads |
| Type assertions in frontend (`as LoanSchedule`) after functions.invoke | `loan-provider.ts`: lines 80, 128 | If Supabase function returns a malformed/missing object, code will break or pass undefined to consumers | Add schema validation or type guards after API calls; fail safely with descriptive errors |
| Lack of interface-based parsing/validation for deeply nested structures | Both files | Nested objects could receive partial/invalid values from BE or FE change | Use type-safe DTOs and validation at all trust boundaries |

## ERROR HANDLING GAPS

| Issue | Location | Risk | Recommended Fix |
|-------|----------|------|-----------------|
| Swallowing/overwriting real errors with generic messages | `loan-schedule/index.ts`: line 97 | UI/API users get poor error diagnostics for debugging, masking root cause in production | Log error details safely, propagate error type/message in dev; sanitize in prod |
| No validation/response for missing required input | `loan-schedule/index.ts`: lines 22-23 | Corrupt or missing input isn't validated, possibly returning unrelated data | Return proper 400 error with clear reason for invalid/missing input |
| No authentication/authorization checks in edge function | `loan-schedule/index.ts` | Any caller with endpoint access can use function, regardless of role or privilege | Validate JWT/auth headers, enforce RBAC inside function according to caller identity |
| No user-facing error detail for external function call failures | `loan-provider.ts`: lines 79, 127 | Users may see blank/empty states if function throws or returns error | Show friendly error with reason and remediation guidance |

---

## PRODUCTION READINESS CONCERNS

| Concern | Location | Risk | Recommended Fix |
|---------|----------|------|-----------------|
| PII (personally identifiable info) processing/logging without redaction | e.g., names or IDs in logs, both files | Sensitive data could be leaked in logs or error traces | Ensure logs redact/mask all PII before writing. Use env flags to suppress PII in prod |
| Development-only code paths weakly segregated via env flag | `loan-provider.ts`, both methods | Use of `import.meta.env.VITE_AUTH_DISABLED` is not reliably dead in prod | Add runtime guardrails and CI/CD build checks to enforce environment correctness |
| No structured logging or audit for function calls | Both files | Inability to trace/monitor suspicious or failed activity | Implement structured audit logs for all actions, including error context, user, and applicationId where possible |
| Missing test coverage for error/edge cases | General (not in files) | Uncaught exceptions and rare failure modes may go unreported to users or ops | Add test coverage (unit + integration) for invalid input, permissions, and error states |

---

## Executive Summary & Recommendations

1. **Implement formal input validation** for all edge functions (use schema validation, not loose object destructure).
2. **Add RBAC/auth guards** to critical Supabase functions.
3. **Improve error transparency** to both users (UI-facing) and operators (logs).
4. **Mask all PII in logs and error tracking.**
5. **Enforce strict separation between dev and prod logic**. Add CI checks so no dev fallback can run in production.
