**Part 1: Security Vulnerability Assessment**  
*Date: 24-10-2025 | Reviewer: [Your Name]*

## Scope

**Files Reviewed:**
- `src/stores/auth.ts` (Zustand auth store)

## CRITICAL (Production Blockers)

| Vulnerability                                              | Location                               | Risk / Attack Scenario                                                                        | Remediation                                                                                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DEV-Only Impersonation/BYPASS Leaks to Production**     | `src/stores/auth.ts` (lines 228–265)   | If environment variables (`DEV` or `VITE_AUTH_DISABLED`) are set incorrectly in prod, anyone could assume any user/role—compromising all account data and control. | Enforce dead code for all impersonation/bypass in production. Add run-time checks for hostname, enforce CI/CD deployment guards, and log all override attempts.  |
| **Authentication Bypass env flag (`VITE_AUTH_DISABLED`)** | `RouteGuard.tsx` (lines 24–27) and `auth.ts` | Setting this flag disables all auth checks, potentially granting public access to privileged areas and actions. | Remove or production-gate this flag. Abort app start or show a blocking warning if it’s set in any deployed environment.         |
| **Over-Permissive Audit Logging (`true` RLS policy)**     | `database-schema.md` (audit_events, lines 53–55) | Anyone (even unauthenticated) can spam/poison audit logs, hiding or covering real malicious/privileged activity. | Restrict insert policy to `auth.uid() IS NOT NULL`. Log actor, IP, and add validation/rate-limiting for critical events.            |

## HIGH (Must Fix Before Launch)

| Vulnerability                                             | Location                        | Risk / Attack Scenario                                                  | Remediation                                                                                                                                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hardcoded, Weak Mock Credentials**                     | `src/types/auth.ts` (25–81)     | If left in production or public, attackers could gain control using known logins.                              | Remove all mock credentials/functions from production builds. Use per-environment test secrets, never hardcoded or source-controlled.                  |
| **First-Role-Only Privilege Assignment**                 | `auth.ts`/`RouteGuard.tsx`      | If user’s role array is unordered/manipulable, privilege confusion/escalation is possible.                    | Always check against the *full* role array for all RBAC decisions, never the first item only. Refactor guards/checks for multi-role.                   |
| **Unprotected Session Storage for “Impersonation”**      | `auth.ts` (lines 39–41, 301–335)| Session data for impersonated (DEV) users is stored in `sessionStorage`, easily injectable and reusable across browsers. | Invalidate impersonated sessions on env/origin change; sign or encrypt session data; strictly forbid import/export across environments.                 |

## MEDIUM (Should Fix)

| Vulnerability                                         | Location                    | Risk / Attack Scenario                                                      | Remediation                                                           |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Incomplete Audit Logging for Privilege Escalation** | `auth.ts`, `database-schema.md` | Not all power actions, failed or successful, are comprehensively logged.    | Extend audit logging to all elevation and impersonation, include full actor/target/IP metadata.|
| **Role Guard Supports Only Single Role**              | `RouteGuard.tsx` (lines 41–43) | Users with multiple roles could be denied rightful access or gain unintended access.         | Refactor guard to accept any matching role in a user’s roles array.    |
| **No Rate Limiting/Brute-Force Defense in Auth Flows**| Backend/edge logic           | Unchecked login/sign-up attempts expose users to automated password guessing. | Confirm/implement backend (Supabase) rate limiting, add FE warnings and MFA when possible.   |
| **No Client-Side PII Masking or Field Encryption**    | `auth.ts`, `database-schema.md` | Exposure of emiratesId, phone, etc. without masking or encryption.          | Mask/redact PII on client and logs, enforce TLS on all communications. |
| **No FE Session Timeout/Expiry**                     | `src/stores/auth.ts`         | Stale sessions (esp. impersonation/dev) can be hijacked via XSS or remaining browsers.        | Enforce inactivity and absolute expiry timeouts; match Supabase session policies.   |

## Executive Recommendations

**Immediate Priority:**  
1. Remove all DEV-only and authentication bypass code paths in production.  
2. Reinforce and expand RLS for all tables, especially audit and role escalation.
3. Refactor all RBAC guards to check the full `roles` array.
4. Mask and secure all stored/handled PII & session artifacts.
5. Implement comprehensive audit and incident logging.
6. Ensure strong rate limiting and add MFA for all high-value actions or accounts.

**Summary:**  
The foundation is solid, but several "AI-gen" safety shortcuts (DEV bypass, mock users, weak RBAC) present critical risks in a regulated fintech context. Prioritizing strict environment controls, robust multi-role enforcement, and data protection will accelerate your path to a compliant, production-ready launch.
